# Scraping a Turkish Website with Pagination
  In this notebook we are going to scrape the "complaints" from the website https://www.sikayetvar.com/ where people write their complaints about a product, brand,
  etc. Before explaining this notebook in detail I would like to give a little bit of information about web scraping.
  
# What Is Web Scraping?
  Web scraping basically helps you to take the public data on web and manipulate it as you like. For web scraping, you need to have some basic knowledge about:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Python

# About the Notebook
  This notebook is going to scrape the publicly available data on https://www.sikayetvar.com/ about a product called "Ülker Çikolatalı Gofret" which is a kind of a
  wafer where the name "Ülker" represents the brand of the product. We are going use `Beautiful Soup` library for pulling the data from HTML files. The necessary
  packages and codes can be found in the notebook.
